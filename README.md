###How to Play
-
This Game called `Banana That` is a simple game that tests your finger and eye coordination. By using your touchpad on your expensive ass laptop you can click the various buttons to start or reset the game. If you click the Banana button guess what will appear...an ORANGE. :unamused: Actually just a banana will appear but wait this is not an ordinary banana, you can click the banana to add points to your score. The first person to play is player A and the second person to play is Player Q. :satisfied: Unfortunately the second person to play is just player B (i know very complex stuff). I might lose you hear so try to pay close attention...there is a count down timer once the count down hits 0 for the first person to play it will show that person's score not only next to the word `score `but on an alert to. After the second person has had a chance to click the moving banana as many times as she or he can before the count down hits 0. Another alert will redudanlty tell you that person's score and tell you if there is a tie or who won. 

**For every click on the banana it will decrease in size and move faster.** :smiling_imp: ***No you dont get additional points for clicking on something that is more difficult to click.*** :smiling_imp:

###Used Technologies
-
To create this simple game I practiced coding with

1. HTML - Text on the page
2. CSS - Made it look decent
3. Javascript - Page Functionality
4. jQuery - Faster Page Functionality

###Unsolved Problems 
-
1. Have the game go back to player A once player B finished
2. Add modes to the game
3. Have a name input box

###Things Not Taught In Class
-

I implemented a cursor change from regular arrow to crosshair when the player goes over the banana to know when to click. This was implemented to assist each player, here is the syntax.

```css
 img {cursor: crosshair}

```
